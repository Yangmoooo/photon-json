# Photon JSON

Welcome to Photon JSON, a naive JSON library built as a C learning project. This project draws inspiration from [json-tutorial](https://github.com/miloyip/json-tutorial) and [c_std](https://github.com/KaisenAmin/c_std). Photon JSON is designed to be simple and efficient, suitable for educational purposes and basic JSON processing needs.

## Features

- Standards-Compliant JSON Parser and Generator
- Supports Null, Boolean, Number, String, Array, and Object
- Double Precision for Numbers
- Dynamic JSON Structure for Creation and Manipulation Arrays and Objects
- Handwritten Recursive Descent Parser
- Modern C11 Standard
- Cross-Platform (On Windows you may need Make and Bash provided by Git)
- UTF-8 Support

## Usage

To use Photon JSON, include the header file `photjson.h` and link the source file `photjson.c` with your project. This library is designed to be simple and easy to use. Detailed documentation can be found in `photjson.h`. You can use `make test` to build and run the test suite.

## Contributing

As a learning project for myself, I am open to any suggestions, improvements, and contributions. Please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
